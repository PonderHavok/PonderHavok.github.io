      Dawn of Dad!
    </h2>
    
    <p style= text-align:center; style="none">
        Since the dawn of time, there have been Dad's.
    <ul style= text-align:center>
        <list style="none">Good Dads</li>
        <li style="none">Bad Dads</li>
        <li style="none">Big Dads</li>
        <li style="none">Small Dads</li>
        <li style="none">Present Dads</li>
        <li style="none">Absent Dads</li>
        <li style="none">All kinds of Dads</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

 <p> 
Dad's are amazing, in all shapes and sizes. They protect us, love us, guide us, and provide for us. 
Dad's are one of the main two reasons of how we are here. Dad's teach us to survive and tough this hard world.
I realize both parent roles are the unspoken heros of History. But this page is about Dad.

What Makes a Dad?
</h2>

<p>
    Is it his strength? Is it his hardwork? Is it his time present with us? Is it his attention on us? Is it his effort with us?
    There are many schools of thought as to what makes a Dad. I'm sure there are even debates on the difference between Dads and Fathers and which is more important.
    I think that what makes a Dad is his Magnum Opus.
</p>

<h2 style= text-align:center;>
    Magnu...What?
</h2>

<p> 
    Magnum Opus. It's Latin for single greatest work. In other words his greatest achievement, greatest deed, greatest gift, greatest contribution to all mankind. 
    Am I painting a picture for you yet? It's is undoubtedly You, the child. 
</p>

<h2 style= text-align:center;>
    I AM NOT A CHILD!
</h2>

<p>
    Are you sure? Whether your Dad is here or gone. Whether you're 2 or 102. YOU ARE A CHILD. You are the product of two individuals. They raised and taught you besides actually creating you. 
    In your upbringing they form you, shape you, mold you, (with all hopes) into a great person. Into who you are! The lessons taught to you were taught to them by their parents and so on.
    So a Dad's Magnum Opus is you as your Magnum Opus will be your child. I say this because you hold within you the Tome of all your family's knowledge. You hold the genetic keys unique of your family, meant to continue.
    You hold the keys to the continuation of the entire human race. When you have children, they will continue on as the legacy of humanity moves forever onward. 
</p>

<h2 style= text-align:center;>
So Now What?
</h2>

<p>Now all you can do is study, learn, push yourself, grow, reach for limitless possibilities. Never settle for the sky being your limit, there are footprints on the moon and tire tracks on mars. Strive to make you addition 
    to humanity one for the ages. Learn to be a good friend, partner, parent, an astronaut, a programer, whatever you want. Learn to be tolerant of all your brothers and sisters. Learn and teach and be a stable foundation for the human race to push of forever onward.
